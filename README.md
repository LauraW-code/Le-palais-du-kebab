## Project 1

# Le Palais du Kebab

This project was my first collaborative project during the web developper course with Wild COde School.

Its goal was to create a showcase website for a restaurant, to learn the ropes of HTML and CSS, and start to include a bit of PHP.

Working as a team for the first time was very instructive, especially in terms of organizing tasks and time management.
